= Grip

Attachment plugin for MongoMapper that uses GridFS.

== Usage

Declare the plugin and use the attachment method to make attachments.

  class Foo
    include MongoMapper::Document
    plugin Grip

    attachment :image
    attachment :pdf
  end

This gives you #image, #image=, #pdf, and #pdf=. The = methods take any IO that responds to read (File, Tempfile, etc). The image and pdf methods return a GridIO instance (can be found in the ruby driver).

== Dependencies

* MongoMapper 0.7.1 - gem install mongo_mapper
* Wand >= 0.2.1 - gem install wand

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
